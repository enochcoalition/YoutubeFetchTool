This is a simple tool I built with a friend to demonstrate a effective YouTube Fetch tool that retrieves about 10 YouTube videos at the click of a button using unique ID numbers from randomly generated YouTube videos. 

Check it out and make sure it works. It seems to work fine on my side :D. 

For feedback shoot me a tweet @callmekain on Twitter or email me at enochcoalition@gmail.com! 

Happy hacking!
